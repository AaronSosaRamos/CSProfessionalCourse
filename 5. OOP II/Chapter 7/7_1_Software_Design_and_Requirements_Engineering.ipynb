Requirements engineering plays a crucial role in the early stages, where requirements are elicited, analyzed, documented, and validated. Software design follows, where system architecture, modules, interfaces, and data structures are designed to meet the specified requirements. The design phase bridges the gap between requirements and implementation, providing a blueprint for building the software system.\n",

Architectural design focuses on high-level abstractions, defining the overall structure, components, and their interactions. Detailed design delves into lower-level details, specifying algorithms, data structures, and implementation specifics. Separation of concerns is achieved by partitioning the system into modules, each addressing a specific aspect or responsibility. Information hiding restricts access to implementation details, promoting modularity and encapsulation. Coupling and cohesion measure the relationships between modules, aiming for loose coupling and high cohesion to improve maintainability and reusability. Reuse of standard structures involves leveraging existing libraries, frameworks, and design patterns to expedite development and enhance quality.\n",
