        "#Execution Problems Caused by Dependencies\n",
        "\n",
        "When implementing pipelining, execution problems can arise due to dependencies between instructions. These problems can impact pipeline efficiency and performance. Here are the main types of dependencies and how they affect pipeline operation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data Dependencies\n",
        "\n",
        "* Description: Occur when one instruction depends on the result of another instruction that has not yet completed its execution.\n",
        "* Types:\n",
        "* Read After Write (RAW) Dependency: An instruction attempts to read an operand before the instruction writing it has completed.\n",
        "* Write After Write (WAW) Dependency: Two instructions attempt to write to the same register or memory location, with the second instruction overwriting the result of the first.\n",
        "* Impact on Pipelining: Can cause pipeline stalls while waiting for dependencies to be resolved.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Control Dependencies\n",
        "\n",
        "* Description: Occur when instruction execution depends on a control decision, such as a conditional branch instruction.\n",
        "* Impact on Pipelining: Can necessitate predicting or waiting for resolution of conditional branches, affecting instruction flow in the pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Structural Dependencies\n",
        "\n",
        "* Description: Occur when multiple instructions contend for the same hardware resource simultaneously.\n",
        "* Example: Two instructions requiring access to the same functional unit (e.g., ALU) at the same pipeline stage.\n",
        "* Impact on Pipelining: May require inserting bubbles (NOPs) into the pipeline to resolve structural conflicts."

        "* Forwarding (Bypassing): Directly sends data from an earlier pipeline stage to a later stage to avoid delays.\n",
