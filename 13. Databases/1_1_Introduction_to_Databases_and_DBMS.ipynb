        "The evolution of database systems reflects a progression from simple file-based data management to sophisticated relational and non-relational database models. Initially, systems relied on hierarchical and network models, which organized data in tree-like structures or graphs. However, these models lacked flexibility and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "The relational model, introduced by Edgar Codd in the 1970s, revolutionized database management by organizing data into tables with rows and columns. This model, implemented in relational database management systems (RDBMS) like IBM's DB2, Oracle, and later MySQL and PostgreSQL, offered powerful querying capabilities using Structured Query Language (SQL).\n",

NoSQL databases, including document-oriented, key-value, columnar, and graph databases, provide flexible data models suitable for diverse use cases such as web applications, big data analytics, and real-time processing."
